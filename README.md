## Getting Started

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone 
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 
3. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

## How It Works

The website fetches data from a JSON server at http://localhost:3000/characters. When the "See all animals" button is clicked, the data is retrieved and each animal's information is rendered on the page.

Users can click the "Like" button to like an animal. The button updates its content and style based on whether the user has liked the animal or not. The like count is incremented or decremented accordingly, and the server is updated with the modified data.

Users can also leave comments on each animal's page. The comments are added dynamically to the comment section and can be deleted by clicking the "x" button.

## Animal Data

The animal data is stored in a JSON format. Here are a few examples of animals included in the data:

- Mr. Cute
- Mx. Monkey
- Ms. Zebra
- Dr. Lion
- Mme. Panda

Each animal includes details such as the name, image URL, and number of votes.
